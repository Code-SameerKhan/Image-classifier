# Sports-personality-classifier
Model developed to identify an image and classify accordingly.

Image classification falls under classification algorithm of Machine learning.
Classification algorithm works under the premise of finding the pattern and associate it with a class.
In this project, a model is developed to perform similar objective but with a little upgradation.

Similar to the regular numerical nature of data, images are identified by the machine in the form of array consisting of numerical values and depending upon the color scheme it
can be divided into 3 dimension or 2 dimension (i.e, in the case of Black and white image or Gray Scalled image)
