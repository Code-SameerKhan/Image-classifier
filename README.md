# Sports-personality-classifier
Model developed to identify an image and classify accordingly.

Image classification falls under classification algorithm of Machine learning.
Classification algorithm works under the premise of finding the pattern and associate it with a class.
In this project, a model is developed to perform similar objective but with a little upgradation.

Similar to the regular numerical nature of data, images are identified by the machine in the form of array consisting of numerical values and depending upon the color scheme it
can be divided into 3 dimension or 2 dimension (i.e, in the case of Black and white image or Gray Scalled image)

# Importing an Image
Using the OpenCV library we import images onto our Jupyter notebook to perform some tests to identfy and spot differences.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library that detect and recognize faces to classify human action.
